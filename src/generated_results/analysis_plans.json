    "description": "Build a multivariate model to explain revenue at the transaction level and decompose the contribution of units_sold, unit_price, discount_rate and marketing_spend while controlling for product, channel, region and customer demographics. This analysis will estimate price and discount elasticity, the marginal ROI of marketing spend, and interaction effects (e.g., whether marketing is more effective for certain products or channels). Missing region values (248 rows) will be handled explicitly (missing-as-category + sensitivity imputations) so results are robust.",
    "business_value": "Provides actionable levers to increase top-line revenue and margin: where to increase/decrease prices, which discounts are counterproductive, and how to reallocate marketing budgets to maximize revenue/ROI. Directly informs pricing strategy, promotion planning and marketing spend allocation.",
    "methodology": "1) Data prep: convert date to time features, encode product/channel/region (treat missing region as explicit category), normalize numeric predictors. 2) Exploratory: correlation matrix, partial dependence plots. 3) Modeling: regularized linear model (elastic net) and a tree-based model (XGBoost/LightGBM) predicting revenue; include interaction terms (price*discount, marketing*channel, product*region). 4) Explainability: SHAP values / additive feature attribution to quantify contribution per feature and per segment. 5) Robustness: rerun with region-imputed alternatives and with revenue per-unit (revenue/units_sold) as secondary target. 6) Estimated KPI: marginal revenue per $ of marketing_spend, price elasticity by product/channel, discount impact on units and revenue.",
    "expected_insights": "\u2022 Numeric elasticity estimates: percent change in revenue per 1% change in unit_price and discount_rate (overall and by product).  \n\u2022 Marketing ROI curve: marginal revenue generated per incremental $ of marketing_spend and diminishing-return threshold by product/channel.  \n\u2022 Interaction findings: channels or products where discounts increase units but reduce total revenue vs where discounts are accretive.  \n\u2022 Ranked list of features by impact (SHAP) and a short list of high-impact actions: e.g., increase price for Product Beta in Online channel by X% expected to increase revenue by Y; reduce discount depth for Alpha in Wholesale because it reduces revenue per transaction.  \n\u2022 Output artifacts: coefficient table with CIs, SHAP summary plot, PDPs for price/marketing, a decision table with recommended price/discount and marketing caps by product-channel (CSV + visuals).",

    "description": "Analyze drivers of repeat_customer (binary) and returned (binary) to profile customers most likely to repurchase and those likely to return. Combine descriptive cohort analysis with predictive classification models to produce targeting rules (who to incentivize, who to avoid over-discounting) and operational thresholds to reduce returns. Use date to construct simple cohorts (e.g., monthly acquisition cohorts) for retention trends.",
    "business_value": "Increases customer lifetime value by identifying segments with highest repeat propensity and low return risk; reduces cost and churn by proactively adjusting offers (e.g., targeted offers to high-LTV prospects) and operational policies to curb returns.",
    "methodology": "1) Data prep: create cohort bins from date (acquisition month), create RFM-lite proxies using units_sold/revenue, encode categorical features. 2) Descriptive cohorts: retention rate by cohort, product, channel and region (handle missing region explicitly). 3) Predictive: train two classification models (logistic regression + gradient boosting) for repeat_customer and returned. Use features: product, region, channel, customer_age, unit_price, discount_rate, units_sold, marketing_spend, revenue. 4) Calibration & evaluation: ROC/AUC, precision@k, lift charts, and confusion matrices; derive decision thresholds optimized for business tradeoffs (e.g., maximize expected revenue uplift subject to acceptable return rate). 5) Action rules: produce simple if-then targeting rules (e.g., customers >35 buying Product Gamma in Online with discount <10% have 2x repeat rate) and scorecards for targeting.",
